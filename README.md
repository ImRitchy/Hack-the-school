# Hack-the-school
This game has been done in 4 days by 3 students and myself. You may find some bugs, and the characters have no textures.
The game is still playable, don't worry.

-> objective : Hack the school by stealing teachers' stuff without getting caught

-> controls : Z,Q,S,D to move, space to jump, C to crouch, A to interract, Left click to throw paper. Control can be changed before starting the game (main menu)

-> tips : There is 1 object to take per room. You'll get a checkpoint after finishing each room. Crouching make you less visible to teachers. Throwing things could disturb them and help you win.
